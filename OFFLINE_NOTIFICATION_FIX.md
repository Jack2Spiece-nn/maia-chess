# Offline Notification Fix Report

## Issue Description
The deployed Maia Chess application on Render was showing a persistent "You're offline. Some features may not work." notification even though the game and AI were functioning correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by faulty network connectivity detection in the frontend application:

1. **Missing Favicon File**: The network detection code in `usePerformanceMonitor.ts` was trying to load `/favicon.ico` to test connectivity, but this file didn't exist.

2. **Failed Network Test**: When the favicon failed to load, the app incorrectly interpreted this as being offline and displayed the warning notification.

3. **Icon References**: The `index.html` referenced `/chess-icon.svg` which was also missing.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Network Detection Logic
**File**: `frontend/src/hooks/usePerformanceMonitor.ts`

**Changed**: Replaced the favicon-based network test with a more reliable method:
```typescript
// OLD: Tried to load non-existent favicon
img.src = '/favicon.ico?' + Math.random();

// NEW: Uses fetch to test connectivity to the same origin
fetch(window.location.origin, { 
  method: 'HEAD',
  cache: 'no-cache',
  mode: 'no-cors'
})
```

### 2. Created Missing Icon Files
**Files Created**:
- `frontend/public/chess-icon.svg` - SVG chess knight icon
- `frontend/public/favicon.ico` - Copy of the SVG for favicon compatibility

## Benefits of the Fix

1. **Accurate Network Status**: The app now correctly detects network connectivity
2. **No False Offline Warnings**: The misleading notification will no longer appear when online
3. **Improved User Experience**: Users won't be confused by incorrect offline status
4. **Better Icon Support**: Proper favicon and icon files are now available

## Technical Details

- **Network Test Method**: Changed from image loading to HTTP HEAD request
- **Test Frequency**: Still checks every 30 seconds as before
- **Fallback Handling**: Maintains the same offline/slow/online status system
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal - HEAD requests are lightweight

## Deployment
These changes will take effect on your next deployment to Render. The frontend build process will include the new icon files and updated network detection logic.

## Verification
After deployment, you should no longer see the "You're offline" notification when the app is actually online and functioning correctly.
