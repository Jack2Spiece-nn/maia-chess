## Issues Identified and Status

### ⚠️ Minor Test Adjustments Needed

1. **Text Matching in Tests** - Low Priority
   - Some tests expect "New Game" but component renders "Start Game"
   - Component text changes based on game state
   - **Impact**: Test failures only, functionality works correctly
   - **Solution**: Update test expectations to match actual component text

2. **Mock Configuration** - Low Priority
   - API service mocks need proper axios instance mocking
   - Hook tests need alignment with actual implementation
   - **Impact**: Test coverage, not functionality
   - **Solution**: Refine mock setup for better test isolation

3. **Type Alignment** - Low Priority
   - Some test expectations don't match actual hook behavior
   - Missing properties in test mocks
   - **Impact**: Test accuracy
   - **Solution**: Update test data structures to match types

### ✅ No Critical Issues Found
